            <li>The graph shows a consistent upward trend in the obesity rate among Americans over the two decades, rising from 30.5% in 2000 to 41.9% in 2023-2024. This indicates a significant and ongoing public health challenge.</li>
            <li>There was a notable acceleration in the increase of obesity rates starting from 2003-2004, peaking around 2013-2014. This period saw some of the sharpest rises, suggesting changes in lifestyle, diet, or economic factors during these years that might have contributed to the rise in obesity.</li>
            <li>The data suggests a plateau in obesity rates from 2017-2018 through 2021-2022, where the percentage stabilizes at 42.4%. This could indicate that certain factors, such as public health initiatives or changes in social awareness about obesity, might be starting to influence and stabilize these rates.</li>
            <li>The overall trend signifies substantial public health implications, including increased healthcare costs, higher prevalence of obesity-related illnesses (like diabetes and heart disease), and potential impacts on the quality of life and life expectancy of a significant portion of the population.</li>
            <li>The persistent high obesity rates highlight the need for effective public health interventions.</li>

            <li>The Southern and Midwestern states tend to have higher obesity rates than the coastal states.</li>

         <ol>
            <li>The map shows pronounced regional disparities, with states like Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico displaying significantly higher counts of low-income populations located more than 10 miles from a supermarket. These areas could face unique challenges due to both economic factors and geographic isolation.</li>
            <li>The Southwest, particularly noticeable with Arizona and New Mexicoâ€™s high counts, indicates a critical need for improved access to affordable and nutritious food options for low-income residents in these largely rural and possibly desert areas.</li>
            <li>The Central Plains states, including parts of Nebraska and Kansas, also show higher counts, suggesting that in these agricultural-heavy regions, low-income populations may still be distanced from essential food retail services.</li>
            <li>The Southeastern states, while moderately affected, show less extreme counts compared to the Southwest. This could reflect a different spatial distribution of supermarkets.</li>
            <li>Texas stands out with a high count of low-income populations at considerable distances from supermarkets. This could reflect both the large rural areas of Texas as well as border regions with Mexico, where economic disparities are significant, and infrastructure might not adequately serve the widespread, low-income rural communities.</li>

         <ol>
            <li>The map shows significant geographic disparities in the number of housing units without vehicle access and located more than 10 miles from a supermarket. States like Texas, California, and Florida exhibit higher counts, indicating regions where transportation and food access are major challenges.</li>
            <li>States like Nevada and Montana also show considerable counts, which might reflect the challenges faced by populations in mountainous and less densely populated regions where distances to basic amenities naturally increase and public transport options are limited.</li>
            <li>Despite being highly urbanized, California shows a high count, likely reflecting both rural areas far from urban centers and urban pockets where households do not own vehicles due to economic reasons or lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li>Vehicle ownership rates might be higher in the Midwest compared to more urbanized or economically disparate regions. This could be due to the necessity of having a vehicle in rural and semi-rural areas where public transportation options are limited or non-existent.</li>
            <li>The Northeastern and Northwestern states have lower house counts than most of the Southern states.</li>

         <ol>
            <li>A substantial portion of the U.S. population, about 65%, lives more than half a mile from a supermarket, indicating widespread challenges in accessing fresh food and groceries.</li>
            <li>As the distance from a supermarket increases, the affected population decreases, but those farther distances represent severe access issues for those involved. Nearly 37% of the population lives more than a mile away, and although only about 1.5% live beyond 10 miles, this still represents a significant number of individuals in potentially rural or underserved areas.</li>
            <li>The sharp drop in population numbers beyond 10 and 20 miles suggests a distinction between urban and rural access.</li>
            <li>The data points to potential food deserts, especially in the segments of the population living more than a mile from a supermarket. This could affect dietary choices and health outcomes.</li>
            <li>The small but significant numbers at the extreme end of the spectrum (beyond 10 and 20 miles) suggest pockets of extreme rural areas where supermarket access is a critical issue.</li>

         <ol>
            <li>Approximately 16% of the total U.S. population in 2021 are children living more than half a mile from a supermarket. This could highlight the challenges families face in providing regular access to nutritious food for their children.</li>
            <li>As distance increases, fewer children are affected, but the numbers remain significant, with about 9% living more than a mile away. This indicates that a considerable number of children in urban and suburban areas still face barriers to easy supermarket access.</li>
            <li>There is a stark reduction in numbers beyond 10 miles, where only about 0.35% of children live.</li>
            <li>The data indicates potential target areas for interventions such as mobile food pantries or school-based nutritional programs, especially for those children living more than a mile from a supermarket.</li>
            <li>The children living more than 20 miles from a supermarket, although a small fraction (about 0.04% of the total population), represent extreme cases of access issues.</li>

         <ol>
            <li>About 8.7% of the total U.S. population in 2021 are seniors living more than half a mile from a supermarket. This figure highlights a substantial accessibility challenge for older adults, who may have limited mobility and higher nutritional needs.</li>
            <li>As the distance from supermarkets increases, the number of affected seniors decreases. However, 5% living more than a mile away and about 0.26% living beyond 10 miles still represent significant segments of the senior population facing serious access issues.</li>
            <li>The drastic decrease in numbers beyond 10 and 20 miles suggests that while fewer seniors live at these distances, those who do are likely very isolated. This isolation could impact their ability to obtain necessary goods and services, including food.</li>
            <li>The data suggests key opportunities for targeted community support programs, such as grocery delivery services, community transport options, or mobile markets, especially aimed at seniors who live more than a mile from a supermarket.</li>
            <li>Rural seniors, represented more in the 10 and 20 miles categories, might face unique challenges that require specifically tailored solutions.</li>
